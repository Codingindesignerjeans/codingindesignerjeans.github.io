      </header>
      <p>GROWING UP I WAS OBSESSED BY AN 8-BIT COMMODORE 64 GAME CALLED CAULDRON, THAT WAS STORED ON A 5 1/4 INCH FLOPPY DISK (INSERT JOKE ABOUT HOW IT WAS THE STANDARD AT THE TIME HERE. YES, I'M OLD!). CAULDRON WAS A FIRST PERSON GAME WHERE YOU PLAYED A WITCH TRYING TO COLLECT INGREDIANTS TO DEFEAT THE DREADED PUMPKIN KING!</p>

      <p>RECENTLY, I DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO REVIVE MY LONG ABANDONED INNER CHILD AND PURSUE MY MORE CREATIVE INTERESTS. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT GIVES ME A CHANCE TO FOLLOW A PASSION THAT WOULD MAKE THE 8 YEAR OLD ME LAUGH, KNOWING THAT I WILL SPEND MOST OF MY TIME GLARING AT THE SCREEN WILLING THE CODE TO WORK, JUST LIKE I DID BACK THEN, WILLING THE WITCH TO KILL THE BATS THAT FLEW AROUND THE SKY IN CAULDRON! </p>

      <p>OUTSIDE OF GLARING AT MY COMPUTER AS THOUGH IT IS, AT TIMES, MY MORTAL ENEMY, I ENJOY THE OUTDOORS. I AM AN AVID READER, STARGAZER, WINE ENTHUSIAST, AND PSEUDO CHEF. I ALSO HAVE A CAT NAMED ARCHIBALD WHO IS A LITTERAL HOUSE GREMLIN. AND NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, I PROBABLY AM THE WITCH FROM CAULDRON. ACHIEVEMENT UNLOCKED!</p>

      <p>I AM EXCITED TO START THIS NEW LEVEL IN MY LIFE AND LOOK FORWARD TO JOINING A COMMUNITY OF CREATIVES WITH SIMILAR PASSIONS, WITCHES INCLUDED!</p>
